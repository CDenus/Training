# ðŸ§  Training Repository

Welcome to my learning repository! Here you will find a collection of notes and practical exercises from the courses that I've completed in Coursera and Open Webinars. This space is designed to be a personal resource, and at the same time, a showcase of my dedication to continous learning and skill development.

## ðŸš€ Â¿QuÃ© puedes encontrar aquÃ­?

In this repo, I've organised the resources by course, each in its own directory. Below is a brief description of what can you expect:

- **Notes**: Summaries and key concepts that I've learned in each course.
- **Practical exercises**: Proyects and task that I've completed, along with my solutions and reflections.
- **Aditional resources**: Links and materials that I consider useful for deepening the topics covered.

## ðŸŒŸ My goal

My goal is to keep growing and sharing my learnings. I hope this repo serves not only as a reference tool for me but also inspire others in their learning journey.

## ðŸ“š Included courses

- [Course 1: Excel & VBA](https://github.com/CDenus/Training/tree/main/Excel%26VBA)
